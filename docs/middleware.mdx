When we make requests a lot of the time there is some consistent logic between all of our endpoints such as authentication or error handling. This is where middleware come in!

## Defining & Adding Middleware

Middleware are functions that return an object whose keys are event names and values are listeners to those events. These event listeners must be async

```typescript title="/auth-middleware.ts"
import { RequestMiddleware } from "api-def";

const getAuthToken = (): Promise<string> => {
  return /*... */;
};

/*
 Add auth header to requests
*/
const AuthMiddleware = (): RequestMiddleware => {
  return {
    // called before a send occurs
    beforeSend: async (context) => {
      const authToken = await getAuthToken();

      if (authToken) {
        context.updateHeaders({
          Authorization: `Referer ${authToken}`,
        });
      }
    },
  };
};

export default AuthMiddleware;
```

Now that we have our fancy new middleware we can add it to our api:

```typescript {6} title="/api.ts"
import { Api } from "api-def";

const API = new Api({
  name: "My Backend",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:5000/v1",
  middleware: [AuthMiddleware()],
});

export default API;
```

## Events

| Name                  | Usage
| ---                   | ---
| `beforeSend`          | Called before send.
| `success`             | When the request was a success.
| `error`               | The request failed. May be called multiple times due to retries
| `unrecoverableError`  | The request failed. Called only once when all retires have been tried. A normal error event is also triggered with this one


## Event Results

Your event listeners can also return special objects that will trigger certain things

### Respond

Applicable in the `beforeSend` event.

Your middleware can respond instead of going to the network which is used in the built-in [cache middleware](./caching)

```typescript
return {
  type: "respond",
  response: {
    status: 200,
    data: ...,
    headers: {}
  }
};
```

### Retry

Applicable in the `error` event.

Trigger a retry despite the `retry` option. Be careful of causing infinite loops with this!

```typescript
return {
  type: "retry"
};
```
